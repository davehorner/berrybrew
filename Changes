          ``berrybrew debug ...''
        - major code restructuring
        - cleaned up Exec() PATH configuration (closes #10, #12 and #23)
        - removed Dir class, path info now stored in member variables
        - added doc/
        - added unit test doc
        - on destruction, we now check for orphaned perl installs, and warn the user
          (closes #16)
        - StrawberryPerl objects are now only generated once, and stored within the BerryBrew
          object
        - removed several unused imports
        - sub command help for the commands that have sub commands
        - 'clean' removes temp files by default, but can also clean orphaned perls with
          the 'orphan' subcommand
        - consolodated ParseJson() and ParseConfig() into the former
        - completed most of the work on the auto updating of the Perls list
        - renamed ParseJson() to JsonParse(), and added JsonWrite()
        - added 'clone', allows cloning of instances with custom names (useful for
          creating perl installation templates, and snapshots)

1.01    2016-07-13
        - added RemoveFilesystemAttributes(), removes RO flag on all files
          in perl install dirs before deleting. C# can't delete them otherwise
        - the API has been separated out into a DLL for re-use and easier
          testing. Source file for the library is berrybrew.cs. The console app
          resides in bbconsole.cs
        - changed to a more Perlish version numbering system

        - fixed issues where %VARIABLE% based PATH entries weren't being
          expanded properly. We now set the registry value to REG_EXPAND_SZ
          type instead of REG_SZ
        - added initial set of basic Perl unit tests

20160702 2016-07-11
        - added 'clean' option, removes all archive zips of perl (closes #5)
        - consolodated directory locations into a class
        - moved almost all console messages to data/messages.json
        - moved perls.json to data/
        - added exception handling for missing and/or malformed json files
        - variable based PATH env vars no longer get expanded and clobbered (fixes #10)
          (reported by PeterCJ (pryrt)
        - add preliminary ability to change Perl installation directory (closes #11)

20160701 2016-07-07
        - fixed bug where PATH wasn't being set correctly when switching perls
        - added release.sh script, performs all tasks related to a release

20160603 2016-06-24
        - added perl.Paths to the struct, holds all three paths in a list
        - re-worked the setting of PATH in exec subshells

20160602
        - added 'off' feature, we now play nice with ActiveState and Strawberry
          Perl installations
        - moved from using the User PATH env var to Machine(System) PATH, so
          that 'off' works correctly

20160501 2016-05-13
         - separated fork from dnmfarrell's original
         - added --with flag for exec, like perlbrew

           file, located in the repo root directory
         - tidied up README
