Revision history for berrybrew

20160703 2016-07-12
        - fixed issues where %VARIABLE% based PATH entries weren't being
          expanded properly. We now set the registry value to REG_EXPAND_SZ
          type instead of REG_SZ

        - added 'clean' option, removes all archive zips of perl (closes #5)
        - consolodated directory locations into a class
        - moved almost all console messages to data/messages.json
        - moved perls.json to data/
        - added exception handling for missing and/or malformed json files
        - variable based PATH env vars no longer get expanded and clobbered (fixes #10)
          (reported by PeterCJ (pryrt)
        - add preliminary ability to change Perl installation directory (closes #11)

        - added perl.Paths to the struct, holds all three paths in a list
        - re-worked the setting of PATH in exec subshells

20160602
        - added 'off' feature, we now play nice with ActiveState and Strawberry
          Perl installations
        - moved from using the User PATH env var to Machine(System) PATH, so
          that 'off' works correctly

         - separated fork from dnmfarrell's original
         - added --with flag for exec, like perlbrew
         - added better ENV handling on spawned sub-shells in exec
         - added ability to load perls available through an external perls.json
           file, located in the repo root directory
         - tidied up README
