Revision history for berrybrew

sb-20160602
        - added 'off' feature, we now play nice with ActiveState and Strawberry
          Perl installations
        - moved from using the User PATH env var to Machine(System) PATH, so
          that 'off' works correctly

         - separated fork from dnmfarrell's original
